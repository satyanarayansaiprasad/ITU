                <p className="mt-2 text-gray-600">
                  I have been practising Taekwondo for over 40 years. Over the years I have seen taekwondo becoming Sports from a hardcore Martial Art. In this Organization you all can learn taekwondo Martial Art. As a Technical Director of this Organization I will be available to all my students, for any kind of technical support.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-2 text-gray-600">
                  Many of my students have taken Taekwondo as their profession. Many sports have lost due to Non Professionalism, that is why I want to make Taekwondo much more professional than it is at present.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-2 text-gray-600">
